## React
There are 3 main components. The upper component showing actual weather and the bottom component made with carousel, both components download props via the component app.
## API
The app gets weather data from api using the react fetch function. https://api.apixu.com/v1/forecast.json?key=b4a3127ec4104f91b38103456192707&q=Paris&days=7 here is an example of api query for Paris. This json gives me 7 days forecast.
## Carousel
The carousel is created using https://github.com/akiran/react-slick. It made the work easier and there were no problems with it.
